          <p>
            I am a PhD student in Contemporary Art History at the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli; my research focuses on the figure of the gallerist and curator Romana Loda. I graduated in Art History from Ca' Foscari University of Venice, and, in 2021, I was selected by the Castello di Rivoli Research Center (CRRI) to participate in the Training Workshop for Contemporary Art Archivists. In the same year, I attended the Masterclass for young curators held by Lorenzo Balbi at the FMAV School of Advanced Training. In 2022, I won the National Prize for Museography and Museology Studies, established by the Ezio de Felice Foundation, for my master's thesis "Rethinking the role of the museum institution in the contemporary: a critical and dialogical perspective." I have extensive professional experience gained in museums, cultural associations, foundations, and art galleries. Since 2023, I have been writing for the Exibart magazine.
