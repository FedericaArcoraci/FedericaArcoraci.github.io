            ART ARCHIVIST WORKSHOP
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was selected to the Contemporary Art Archivists workshop run by CRRI – Castello di Rivoli Research Institute and the Museum Education Department. The workshop was led by art historian and archivist Pietro Rigolo (Assistant Curator for Modern and Contemporary Collections, GRI-Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles).
The program included lectures as well as hands-on exercises, student presentations and discussion rounds with international experts in Contemporary Art Archives, in collaboration with MACBA Study Center (CED), Barcelona; Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; CSAC Centro Studi e Archivio della Comunicazione, Parma; Getty Research Institute and Los Angeles Contemporary Archive, Los Angeles. The seminars focused on: what is an archive, and what are the different types of contemporary art archives; brief history of the archival discipline; how archives are collected: selection and evaluation; how to keep an archive: conservation of paper, photographic material and audio-visual material; how an archive is opened to research: organization and description; MPLP (More Product, Less Processing): discussion on a new paradigm.
