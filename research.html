            ART ARCHIVIST WORKSHOP
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was selected to the Contemporary Art Archivists workshop run by CRRI – Castello di Rivoli Research Institute and the Museum Education Department. The workshop was led by art historian and archivist Pietro Rigolo (Assistant Curator for Modern and Contemporary Collections, GRI-Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles).
The program included lectures as well as hands-on exercises, student presentations and discussion rounds with international experts in Contemporary Art Archives, in collaboration with MACBA Study Center (CED), Barcelona; Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; CSAC Centro Studi e Archivio della Comunicazione, Parma; Getty Research Institute and Los Angeles Contemporary Archive, Los Angeles. The seminars focused on: what is an archive, and what are the different types of contemporary art archives; brief history of the archival discipline; how archives are collected: selection and evaluation; how to keep an archive: conservation of paper, photographic material and audio-visual material; how an archive is opened to research: organization and description; MPLP (More Product, Less Processing): discussion on a new paradigm.

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Title: </span>Redefining archive systems
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract: </span> This article aims to underline the processuality proper of the archives of the present time, highlighting how the archive must be the transparent place of the choice and interpretation of the second document declared, but not for this indisputable, rules. Before the spread of social networks made us all potential archivists, contemporary artists have rethought the forms of cataloging using languages and media available to them. That behind every taxonomic impulse there is a desire for order, a search for identity, impatience for the traditional organization of knowledge and power or a simple horror vacui, at the base there is always the need to return a deeper logic to the traces that are extracted, assemble and re-enter in a new context and load from an unexpected value. Therefore, the archive is no longer just an inert collection of documents from which flows the confusion associated with the process of memory development, but it becomes a critical device capable of regenerating the usual logic of safeguards, use and dissemination of knowledge, reactivating memory and political awareness. In this perspective the artist becomes the primary actor of social and cultural change. This article try to trace the articulated history of interest in archival practice and the meanings that the archive assumes over time and its relevance as a work of art, therefore as an atypical classification system.
